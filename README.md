This plugin is very helpful in filtering only debug statements out of complete debug log.
This works similar to Developer Console Debug only checkbox but on Salesforce org detailed debug logs.

You need to open the debug logs detail page and new checkbox will be by default present.

Limitations - nothing known yet.

Future - 
1. Give alert if debug logs are skipped

Please feel free to let me know any enhancements as issues in this repo.
